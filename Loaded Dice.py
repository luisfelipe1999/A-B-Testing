# # Probability 2: Loaded dice 
# 
# In this assignment you will be reinforcening your intuition about the concepts covered in the lectures by taking the example with the dice to the next level. 
# 
# This assignment will not evaluate your coding skills but rather your intuition and analytical skills. You can answer any of the exercise questions by any means necessary, you can take the analytical route and compute the exact values or you can alternatively create some code that simulates the situations at hand and provide approximate values (grading will have some tolerance to allow approximate solutions). It is up to you which route you want to take! 
# 
# This graded notebook is different from what you might seen in other assignments of this specialization since only your answers are graded and not the code you used to get that answer. For every exercise there is a blank cell that you can use to make your calculations, this cell has just been placed there for you convenience but **will not be graded** so you can leave empty if you want to. 
# 
# However **you need to submit the answer for that exercise by running the cell that contains the `utils.exercise_x()` function**. By running this cell a widget will appear in which you can place your answers. Don't forget to click the `Save your answer!` button.

# ## Some concept clarifications ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²
# 
# During this assignment you will be presented with various scenarios that involve dice. Usually dice can have different numbers of sides and can be either fair or loaded.
# 
# - A fair dice has equal probability of landing on every side.
# - A loaded dice does not have equal probability of landing on every side. Usually one (or more) sides have a greater probability of showing up than the rest.
# 
# Let's get started!

# ## Exercise 1:
# 
# 

# Given a 6-sided fair dice (all of the sides have equal probability of showing up), compute the mean and variance for the probability distribution that models said dice. The next figure shows you a visual represenatation of said distribution:
# 
# <img src="./images/fair_dice.png" style="height: 300px;"/>
# 
# **Submission considerations:**
# - Submit your answers as floating point numbers with three digits after the decimal point
# - Example: To submit the value of 1/4 enter 0.250

# Hints: 
# - You can use [np.random.choice](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.choice.html) to simulate a fair dice.
# - You can use [np.mean](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html) and [np.var](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.var.html) to compute the mean and variance of a numpy array.

np.random.seed(0)
dice_rolls = np.random.choice([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], size=1000000)
mean = np.mean(dice_rolls)
variance = np.var(dice_rolls)
print(f"Mean: {mean:.3f}, Variance: {variance:.3f}")

# ## Exercise 2:
# 
# Now suppose you are throwing the dice (same dice as in the previous exercise) two times and recording the sum of each throw. Which of the following `probability mass functions` will be the one you should get?
# 
# <table><tr>
# <td> <img src="./images/hist_sum_6_side.png" style="height: 300px;"/> </td>
# <td> <img src="./images/hist_sum_5_side.png" style="height: 300px;"/> </td>
# <td> <img src="./images/hist_sum_6_uf.png" style="height: 300px;"/> </td>
# </tr></table>
# 

# Hints: 
# - You can use numpy arrays to hold the results of many throws.
# - You can sum to numpy arrays by using the `+` operator like this: `sum = first_throw + second_throw`
# - To simulate multiple throws of a dice you can use list comprehension or a for loop

# Given a fair 4-sided dice, you throw it two times and record the sum. The figure on the left shows the probabilities of the dice landing on each side and the right figure the histogram of the sum.

# 
# During this assignment you tested your knowledge on probability distributions, descriptive statistics and visual interpretation of these concepts. You had the choice to compute everything analytically or create simulations to assist you get the right answer. You probably also realized that some exercises could be answered without any computations just by looking at certain hidden queues that the visualizations revealed.
